# Vibe coding

QuickDapp is probably one of the first web boilerplates that's built with vibe coding in mind (Of course, you can still code by hand if you wish!).

It ships with a [`CLAUDE.md`](https://github.com/QuickDapp/QuickDapp/blob/main/packages/base/CLAUDE.md) file already present. This file contains instructions for your vibe coding AI to help it build your app _the QuickDapp way_. 

_Note: Feel free to update `CLAUDE.md` with statements specific to your web app, but we recommend leaving the QuickDapp-specific instructions intact._

To get a sense of how easy it is to vibe code with QuickDapp check out one of the [tutorials](./tutorials).
